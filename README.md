HRouter
=====

Macaw is a simple, open source PHP router. It's super small (~150 LOC), fast, and has some great annotated source code. This class allows you to just throw it into your project and start using it immediately.

### Install

If you have Composer, just include Macaw as a project dependency in your `composer.json`. If you don't just install it by downloading the .ZIP file and extracting it to your project directory.

```
require: {
    "hkuang/hrouter": "dev-master"
}
```

### Examples

First, `use` the Macaw namespace:

```PHP
use \kuang\hrouter\router;
```
